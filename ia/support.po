"Ceno is a mobile web browser based on Mozilla Android Components. It is "
"designed for accessing and distributing web content (websites) using a novel "
"approach that relies on BitTorrent – a decentralized file sharing network. "
"Ceno’s advantage comes from side-stepping current Internet censorship "
"methods and allowing people to access and share web information in and "
"across regions where connectivity has been interrupted or compromised."

"In <strong>Public</strong> mode, Ceno will look into the BitTorrent network "
"to see if another Ceno user has recently shared the requested page. If the "

msgid ""
"Our motto is ‘Share the Web!’ and essentially that is what Ceno users are "
"doing. Most web pages have static content (something you read, watch, listen "
"to, etc.). Static content can be packaged and shared with other users "
"seeking the same content. Ceno uses the BitTorrent file sharing network for "
"this."

#: support.html%2Bhtml.body.main.div.section.details.p:173-1

"Ceno’s advantage is evident in a network that censors websites, or where the "
"network is weak or unstable. In these circumstances, the Ceno client is able "
"to leverage additional methods to retrieve content and deliver it to your "
"device. By allowing users to enable sharing of content they have recently "
"retrieved, Ceno expands access to the internet more generally. Whether you "
"are living in a part of the world that restricts access to content, or in a "
"remote area with limited access to the internet, Ceno allows you to access "
"information that may otherwise be unavailable."

"People running Ceno from countries that do not censor the Internet - or from "
"parts of the world where access to the internet is reliable - can choose to "
"act as Bridges for those in heavily restricted networks. The network "
"automatically enrolls new Bridges and keeps track of when they go offline. "
"Running a Bridge is a very simple yet powerful action, allowing you to help "
"others access the Internet."

"Every technology that deals with sensitive use cases has its advantages and "
