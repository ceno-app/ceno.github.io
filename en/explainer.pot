"Ceno Browser is quite different from any other browser you’ve used in the "
"past. It does not function like a VPN or the Tor network. It’s built for "
"connectivity but not anonymity. Ceno’s main premise is cooperation - users "
"can help each other out in getting content otherwise unavailable in their "
"network. Built on top of the BitTorrent network, it is the world’s first "
"mobile browser using decentralized networking to bring you the web."

"So, how does it work? There are two distinct modes of using Ceno - "
"<strong>Public</strong> and <strong>Personal</strong>. You can switch "
"between them at any time. Whilst both modes help you access any website "
"without restriction, they are distinguished by traces of activity that you "
"leave on the network and by general connectivity options afforded to the "
"user. To explain these concepts in everyday terms, we are using the example "
"of books, libraries and bookstores. Now, because this is only a fictional "
"representation of a complicated system - we have also added some Helpers and "
"Couriers into the protocol and infrastructure design. Their job is to help "
"you get the book you want."

"Imagine using Ceno like going to a public library - where every book is a "

"Now that you have this book, you can read it and you can pass it along for "
"others to read. They can pass it on as well. In <strong>Public</strong> mode "
"everyone is there to help you read this book - the publisher, the library "
"that bought it, the person who shared their book with you. However, in "
"<strong>Public</strong> mode everyone can also see that you have rented this "
"book and passed it along to others. It is essentially public."
