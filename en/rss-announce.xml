<description>Please update to the latest version of Ceno Browser by visiting our <a href="https://ceno.app/en/download">download page</a>! 

Reader View mode has been added to enable a beautiful and distraction-free browsing experience, as well as an option to share a page as a PDF or via other apps on your device.

The progress bar showing whether a website is being accessed directly (green), via the Ceno network (orange), or from the Ceno cache (blue) now disappears when a website finishes loading and the primary source of the website is indicated by the color of the dot on the Ceno toolbar icon.

A new error page has been designed to provide more detailed information when the browser fails to retrieve a website.

The interface for viewing and sharing content cached on your device has been updated for better grouping of sites and general usability.</description>
