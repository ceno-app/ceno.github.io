<description>You can easily toggle between them. 
\nPublic mode offers the best connectivity but the least privacy - websites that you visit or share are recorded in a publicly-accessible registry (BitTorrent). 
\nPersonal mode eliminates this record but may be slower and less efficient at retrieving content. See the <a href="https://censorship.no/en/support.html">FAQ</a> or <a href="https://censorship.no/user-manual">User Manual</a> for more details on Ceno usage.</description>
