<description>This month, we are introducing some exciting new features in Ceno Browser!

In an effort to learn more about your experiences with Ceno and how we can improve, you can now opt-in to sharing privacy-preserving metrics with the development team. Please opt in to help us improve Ceno! 

A new Network Status Indicator has been added to the homepage to show at a glance whether you are connected to the Ceno network. Click on the icon to learn more, export logs, and contact support in the event of issues.

Finally, we've added a hidden Developer Tools submenu to declutter the settings options â€“ to access it, tap the "Ceno Browser" version at the bottom of your Settings 7 times.

As always, we welcome your valuable feedback as we work hard to improve Ceno. Thank you for helping to make the web more open and accessible to all!</description>
