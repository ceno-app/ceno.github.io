<description>Please update to the latest version of Ceno Browser by visiting our <a href="https://ceno.app/en/download">download page</a>! 

Ceno v2.3 has been released, incorporating a new guided onboarding experience for first-time users to demonstrate Ceno's unique features and functionality.

You can now change the default language of Ceno Browser via the Settings page. 

In addition, this release updates Ouinet (the peer-to-peer library powering Ceno) to v0.29, which should solve some of the issues the community has been experiencing with bootstrapping to the network.

We welcome your valuable feedback as we work hard to improve Ceno. Thank you for helping to make the web more open and accessible to all!</description>
