<title>Ceno Browser: Explainer</title>

<div class="container-md section">

<h2>Ceno Browser Explainer</h2>

<p>Ceno Browser is quite different from any other browser you’ve used in the past. It does not function like a VPN or the Tor network. It’s built for connectivity but not anonymity. Ceno’s main premise is cooperation - users can help each other out in getting content otherwise unavailable in their network. Built on top of the BitTorrent network, it is the world’s first mobile browser using decentralized networking to bring you the web. </p>

<p>Whilst this may sound relatively attractive, every innovation has its benefits and risks. You should be aware of both before using Ceno Browser. </p>

<p>So, how does it work? There are two distinct modes of using Ceno - <strong>Public</strong> and <strong>Personal</strong>. You can switch between them at any time. Whilst both modes help you access any website without restriction, they are distinguished by traces of activity that you leave on the network and by general connectivity options afforded to the user. To explain these concepts in everyday terms, we are using the example of books, libraries and bookstores. Now, because this is only a fictional representation of a complicated system - we have also added some Helpers and Couriers into the protocol and infrastructure design. Their job is to help you get the book you want. </p>

<h3>Public Mode</h3>
<p>Imagine using Ceno like going to a public library - where every book is a website that you visit and the library itself is the BitTorrent network. You can check out any book for free, however your name will be recorded on that little piece of cardboard inside, along with every other person who has rented it.</p>
<p>Now that you have this book, you can read it and you can pass it along for others to read. They can pass it on as well. In <strong>Public</strong> mode everyone is there to help you read this book - the publisher, the library that bought it, the person who shared their book with you. However, in <strong>Public</strong> mode everyone can also see that you have rented this book and passed it along to others. It is essentially public. </p>

<h3>Personal Mode</h3>

<p>Now, you will be going to a bookstore to get that book you want. The book will belong to you only and no one but the bookstore employee will know that you bought it. You wont share with anyone, nor will you read anyone else’s copy of this book. This is Ceno’s <strong>Personal</strong> mode and we recommend it for when you are logging into websites or when you don’t want anyone to know which websites you have been visiting.</p>

<h3>Helpers</h3>
<p>The librarian and the bookstore employee are Helpers in our network. They are responsible for fetching the desired book from the bookshelves. In Ceno, this role is played by eQualitie - the organization behind the project and maintaining these Helpers. They know who you are and what book you have requested. You’ll have to trust them not to disclose this information to anyone else. On the Internet without Ceno, these Helpers play a similar role to your Internet provider or VPN service.</p>

<h3>Couriers</h3>
<p>You may not be able to visit a library or there may not be a library in your town or country. For this instance we have Couriers. They are located in a different town or country. Their job is to go to their local library or bookstore and pick up the book you desire. Couriers can only talk with a librarian or shopkeeper. They don’t know which book you are interested in - their job is to receive and deliver it to you. Once you receive the book, you can again share it with others (<strong>Public</strong>) or not share it with anyone (<strong>Personal</strong>).</p>

<p>Any Ceno user can become a Courier and we encourage those that live in countries with lots of libraries (unrestricted Internet access) to be Couriers as well. At the moment, over 8000 couriers are online at any one time, waiting for requests to fetch a book for you.  </p>
