You can now choose to enable Bridge Mode on the homepage and help make the Ceno network stronger.

A progress bar has been added to show whether a website is being accessed directly (green) or via the Ceno network (orange).

A loading screen has been added to indicate what's happening "under the hood" when first starting Ceno.</description>
