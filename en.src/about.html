    <h1>What is CENO?</h1>
	<p>CENO is the world’s first mobile browser that circumvents current Internet censorship methods and local Internet outages using peer-to-peer (p2p) technology. Designed to allow people anywhere in the world to access web content in censored or Internet-restricted regions - and in countries where connectivity is unreliable or costly - it can be used to create bridges for others to access censored or restricted content.</p>

Uses a VPN recommended by the media they work for, but still looks for other options. Needs circumvention tools almost every day for work (mostly to access blocked media websites and collect data for their own articles). Appreciates speed and reliability of the tool. Appreciates a lot if the tool also works on desktop, since her work is about writing texts and collecting / analyzing data, and a desktop version could provide more convenience.</p>

He or she has regular digital security trainings, and a rather advanced organizational security policy, but still is not 100 % perfect in their online practices. Uses Telegram, but also Signal, tried other messaging apps (keeps at least 4 of them on their phone) ; uses Tor, but is concerned by the reputation of the tool (main threat model : device seizure during protests / arrests). User 3 needs a good circumvention tool that he or she can access from a mobile phone when he or she is in mobility (during a street demonstration, for example). Reliability is a central feature, since Internet shutdowns or slowdowns are frequent during such events.  </p>

Is interested in decentralization in principle (heard about Mastodon, uses Tor sometimes…). The website of their student organization has recently been blocked by the RosKomNadzor, so they use VPN almost every day to access the resource. Needs a tool that works both on mobile and desktop. Overloaded with work and studies, has too many different tools, and is skeptical about installing a new one, only if it is somewhat multi-functional.</p>

Is a defender of open source and free software. Likes « old school » technologies such as Jabber or IRC, is interested in mesh networking and decentralized/distributed networks (in principle, as architectural solutions, but also for privacy and reliability reasons). Looks for a new distributed circumvention solution that can become an alternative to VPN / Tor. Is skeptical though, needs to have a look at the code or to read someone’s detailed review/audit before actually trusting a tool. Uses Linux and Android, appreciates when apps are available on Fdroid or apks are available directly from GitHub / GitLab. Appreciates even more when builds are available for Linux. Is ready to participate in a project if he/she likes it (either as a « seeder » or a node in the system to help distribute content ; or as a bug reporter).</p>

    <h1>Testimonials</h1>
    <h2>Russia</h2>
	<p>“Nice browser. Without VPN I was able to open blocked resources. But it's also useful when you don't have connection.”</p>
	<p>“Because Russia threatens to block VPNs, CENO is promising. Also because for your ISP it's like some Torrent traffic, and torrents are something very normalized in Russia unlike western countries where copyright is really respected. Also in Moscow police started asking people to show their phones and they look at apps that you have. I had this kind of control. They look at VPNs or messengers like Signal or Telegram. And CENO looks like a normal browser, so when they asked what it is I said it is a browser, no problem, no questions. I just chose to regularly clear browsing history at exit. So besides helping to access websites, it also looks quite innocent which is great.”</p>
	<p>“Thanks for a great product. Your browser opens the site http://meduza.io much faster than the app from @meduzaproject.”</p>
    <h2>Myanmar</h2>
	<p>“There was a lot of inconvenience due to the blocked websites. It's good to see that it works well with this app. This is our digital rights. So I will continue to use it sometimes.”</p>
	<p>“There are more features I'd like to see in the app, but it is totally a convenient and useful application.”</p>
    <h2>Iran</h2>
	<p>“This app is one of our few hopes in times of serious Internet disruptions in Iran. Please keep it going and make it better and better. Thank you.”</p>
	<p>“It is a good browser, especially for us Iranians, who do not have the possibility of free use of the Internet and everything is filtered by the government, even filter breakers."</p>
