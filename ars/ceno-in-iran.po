"<strong>Montreal, December 15, 2022</strong> – eQualitie is pleased to "
"announce that its CENO Browser is fulfilling its mission of assisting "
"thousands in Iran, while also advancing its usefulness in the Russia-Ukraine "
"war. Short for <strong>ce</strong>nsorship.<strong>no</strong>, CENO allows "
"individual mobile users to access and share global web content in spite of "
"Internet censorship tactics and in areas of limited connectivity. In 2022 to "
"date, CENO has helped tens of thousands in Iran, even while their Internet "
"connections have been thwarted."

"Internet shutdowns are becoming more common in undemocratic countries, "
"intensifying the need for decentralized services and tools such as CENO. In "
"Iran, since protests started to surge in mid-September, the regime has been "
"particularly aggressive in suppressing communication outside of its intranet "
"infrastructure, the National Information Network. Among other things, the "
"authorities have been blocking websites and social platforms; disabling "
"mobile data; encrypting DNS services; and collapsing networks."

"CENO has persisted around these ploys, using its robust peer-to-peer "
"backbone, Ouinet, to sidestep every blockage, filter, shutdown and attack. "
"The CENO team is able to extrapolate from its decentralized network that "
"thousands in Iran are now actively using the browser to bypass the national "
"intranet. CENO’s usage also continues to grow in other censored countries, "
"such as Russia, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Pakistan, India, Yemen, Bangladesh and "
"Myanmar. Each install expands the network by creating bridges between "
"devices and enabling users to share blocked, filtered and censored web "
"content."
