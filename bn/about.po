"The majority of internationally-bound traffic in countries that filter "
"content requests are routed through a fixed number of centralized exchanges "
"where surveillance and censorship technology is installed. Traditional "
"circumvention technologies require the user to connect directly to a proxy "
"in the uncensored zone. This design gives the censor an advantage in "
"locating and blocking popular proxies, VPN servers, relays, bridges, etc."

"CENO proposes a fundamentally different solution: reduce the requests to "
"externally available proxy servers and enable the storage of retrieved "
"content inside the censored zone. CENOs advantage comes from being both a "

"Peer-to-peer routing is the ideal solution for the “cat and mouse” scenario "
"that most circumvention providers end up playing with the censor. Clients "
"need not know the location of a proxy to relay censored content, instead "
"using small-world networks to connect to their peers, and thereafter to a "
"bridge in the uncensored zone."

"Once a website is accessed by a single user (node), it is stored and "
"continues to propagate inside the country peer-to-peer. Individual nodes are "
"referenced by an identifier which does not give away their physical "
"location. Content remains available inside the censored zone even if "
"external connectivity is cut. Content can be seeded into the network via "
"alternative means as well (e.g. uploaded from a USB drive)."
