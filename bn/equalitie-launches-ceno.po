"<strong>Montreal, May 10, 2022</strong> – eQualitie, developer of open-"
"source and reusable digital security systems, is pleased to announce the "
"public launch of its newest democratization tool, CENO Browser. Short for "
"<strong>ce</strong>nsorship.<strong>no</strong>, CENO is the world’s first "
"mobile browser that is built specifically to side-step current Internet "
"censorship methods. It also enables people to access and share information "
"in and across regions where connectivity has been interrupted or compromised."

"CENO uses established technologies in new ways. While the user experience is "
"akin to using a standard mobile browser, CENO operates over a peer-to-peer "
"(p2p) network on the open-source Ouinet library and BitTorrent protocols, "
"allowing it to run reliably where other browsers might not or do not. "
"Because the web content is delivered, cached and decentralized via p2p "
"routing, it cannot be forcibly removed by external agents. Furthermore, CENO "
"is equipped to access and share cached content offline and via local area "
"networks (LANs). CENO’s resiliency makes it ideal for those who need stable "
"access to and sharing capabilities of web information during media "
"censorship events, filtering, attacks, shutdowns, natural disruptions, "
"unrest, conflict and war. CENO’s routing and distribution can also "
"significantly reduce bandwidth consumption and associated costs."

"“CENO holds great promise and launches at an opportune time for those "
"engaged in democracy movements and activities,” says Dmitri Vitaliev, "
"founder and director of eQualitie. “It is already helping thousands of "

"internationally to share information on their mobile devices.”"

"CENO is currently being used by hundreds of thousands of people globally, "
"including in Myanmar and Iran, where the military junta and regime routinely "
"disregard the notion of digital rights; in Ukraine, where Russia’s invading "
"army has damaged or destroyed local Internet infrastructures; and in Russia, "
"where an evolving grip of censorship is tightening. CENO works on Android "
